# BoVW
To develop an image classification system using the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset by extracting combined HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) and LBP (Local Binary Patterns) features, clustering them using K-Means, and classifying the images using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
